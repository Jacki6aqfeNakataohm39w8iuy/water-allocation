# Zama Confidential Water Allocation

## Overview

This project explores a novel approach to sustainable water management in agricultural settings using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). Farmers within an irrigation district can submit their water demand forecasts in encrypted form. Our system aggregates these encrypted predictions to optimize water allocation without ever exposing sensitive data.

Traditional water management systems require farmers to disclose their irrigation needs openly, which raises concerns about privacy and competitive disadvantage. By leveraging FHE, we ensure that data remains confidential while still enabling accurate optimization and fair distribution of water resources.

## Why FHE?

Fully Homomorphic Encryption allows computations directly on encrypted data, producing encrypted results that can be decrypted by authorized parties. In the context of water allocation:

* **Privacy Preservation**: Farmers' water demand forecasts remain confidential, preventing exposure of strategic information.
* **Secure Aggregation**: Total water requirements can be computed without revealing individual contributions.
* **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensures adherence to privacy laws and data protection standards in agriculture.
* **Fair Resource Distribution**: Optimizations consider all participants without compromising personal data.

## Features

* **Encrypted Water Demand Submission**: Farmers submit predictions using local IoT devices connected to soil moisture sensors.
* **FHE-Based Optimization Engine**: Processes encrypted inputs to determine optimal water distribution across fields.
* **Automated Irrigation Scheduling**: Generates actionable schedules for irrigation systems while preserving privacy.
* **Concrete Integration**: Implements the encryption and evaluation pipelines with the Concrete library.
* **Python API for Researchers and Developers**: Allows experimentation with new models and data scenarios.

## System Architecture

1. **IoT Data Collection**: Soil sensors and farmer inputs capture localized water requirements.
2. **Client-Side Encryption**: Inputs are encrypted using FHE on farmersâ€™ devices before transmission.
3. **Encrypted Aggregation**: The central server receives encrypted forecasts and computes total demand.
4. **Optimization Module**: Uses linear programming on encrypted data to allocate water fairly.
5. **Decryption and Distribution**: Results are decrypted only by authorized personnel, producing irrigation schedules.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.9+ and the following dependencies:

* Concrete
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Pyomo (for optimization modeling)

Clone the repository and install dependencies using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Submitting Encrypted Forecasts

Farmers use a Python client to encrypt water demand predictions from their soil sensors:

```
from client import encrypt_forecast
forecast = {'field_id': 101, 'water_needed_liters': 500}
encrypted_forecast = encrypt_forecast(forecast)
```

### Optimizing Water Allocation

The server processes encrypted inputs and runs the FHE-based optimization model:

```
from server import optimize_allocation
allocation_plan = optimize_allocation([encrypted_forecast1, encrypted_forecast2])
```

### Generating Irrigation Schedules

After decryption, generate actionable schedules:

```
from schedule import generate_schedule
generate_schedule(allocation_plan)
```

## Security Considerations

* **End-to-End Encryption**: Water demand data remains encrypted throughout transmission and computation.
* **Access Control**: Only authorized personnel can decrypt the optimization results.
* **Audit Logs**: Every forecast submission and decryption operation is logged for traceability.
* **Resistance to Data Leakage**: Even if the server is compromised, raw forecasts remain inaccessible.

## Performance Notes

FHE computations are inherently more resource-intensive than plaintext calculations. Strategies to improve performance include:

* Using batched computations for multiple fields.
* Optimizing encryption parameters to balance security and speed.
* Leveraging cloud-based or edge computing for scalability.

## Roadmap

* **Phase 1**: Core FHE-enabled optimization engine and basic IoT integration.
* **Phase 2**: Real-time scheduling updates and predictive modeling enhancements.
* **Phase 3**: Expanded support for multi-crop irrigation zones and seasonal adjustments.
* **Phase 4**: User-friendly dashboards for farmers and water authorities.
